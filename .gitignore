# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#

# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
*.swp

# Make sure no sensitive data is accidentally committed
# add w/ git add --force if actually docs
*.csv
*.txt
*.xml
*.xls
